# Lift-Simulation

In this project, I created lift simulator. It is based on event queue, with two possible events: Arrival, and departue of the passenger. The behavior of the simulator is parametrized by:
- max number of floors
- travel time between floors
- max number of passenger in lift
- number of lifts

Parameters are specified before simulation. Passenger arrival time is getting from the parametrized exponential distribution. The goal is to check some statistics like average waiting time by passenger, number handled depending on parameters.
